cisco-fc-failover is a simple example on how you can
automate SAN failover using a FC switch. In this example
we have an MDS 9124 with ssh pubkey authentication. It
has two vsans configured which essentially represent
separate switches. The SAN LAN has clients that have
two FC hbas, wired to each vsan.

Disable a vsan and watch a whole mpath group go away.

This code will serve as a baseline for a more aggressive
autotest based failover suite, one that will hopefully
poll the SAN clients and verify that the paths attached
to the relevant vsan have indeed failed.
